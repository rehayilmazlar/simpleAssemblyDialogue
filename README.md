 <h1># Simple Assembly Dialogue</h1>
<h3>A simple assembly dialogue that takes a string and adds 1 to each character and outputs the result. For example "test" becomes "uftu".<h/3>

I used <strong>RadASM</strong> as an <strong>IDE</strong> and <strong>MASM</strong> to compile assembly code. Here we only need three files to create the rest of the files are created by RadASM automatically. Best thing about RadASM is you can create your dialogue visually and add buttons, text box to it etc.

You can find <strong>RadASM</strong> here: https://github.com/mrfearless/RadASM2

 Here is our <strong>Simple Assembly Dialogue</strong> program:<br><br>
Originally our dialogue looks like this:<br>

 And when we enter <strong>"test"</strong> to test our program, it outputs "uftu".<br>
