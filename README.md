 <h1>Simple Assembly Dialogue</h1>
<h3>A simple assembly dialogue that takes a string and adds 1 to each character and outputs the result. E.g. if you input "test" then it outputs "uftu".</h3>

<p align="left">I used <strong>RadASM</strong> as an <strong>IDE</strong> and <strong>MASM</strong> to compile assembly code. Here we only need three files to create, the rest of the files are created by RadASM automatically. Best thing about RadASM is you can create your dialogue visually and add buttons, text box to it etc.
<br>
 <br>Those 3 files we need to create are:
  <ul>
   <li>TestDialogue.asm <em>--Here is our main assembly code</em></li>
   <li>TestDialogue.dlg <em>--Here is the visual dialouge</em></li>
   <li>TestDialogue.Inc <em>--And here is our include file that we include everything we need such as libraries, button IDs, variables etc.</em></li>
  </ul>
You can find <strong>RadASM</strong> here: https://github.com/mrfearless/RadASM2

 Here is our <strong>Simple Assembly Dialogue</strong> program:<br><br>
Originally our dialogue looks like this:<br>
  <img src="https://github.com/rehayilmazlar/simpleAssemblyDialogue/blob/main/Images/1.JPG" />
</p>

<p>
 And when we enter <strong>"test"</strong> to test our program, it outputs <strong>"uftu"</strong>.<br>
